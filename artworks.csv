Henri Matisse,Interior at Nice,France,1919,1920,Oil on canvas,131.5 × 90.7 cm (51 13/16 × 35 11/16 in.),Gift of Mrs. Gilbert W. Chapman,1956.339,"['Modern Art', 'Essentials']",,"<p>Beginning in 1917, Henri Matisse spent most winters in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. He often stayed at the Hôtel Mediterranée, a Rococo-style building he later fondly termed &quot;faked, absurd, delicious!&quot; <em>Interior at Nice</em> is perhaps the most ambitious of a series of images the painter created using the hotel as a backdrop. The pink-tiled floors and yellow, arabesque-patterned wall-paper are present in many of these works, as are the skirted dressing table, oval mirror, shuttered French window, and balcony. The balcony in fact was one of the artist’s favorite themes, allowing him to link internal and external space into a continuum structured by patterns and modulated light.</p>
<p>Additionally, Matisse often included a young woman somewhere in the scene. Here, his favorite model at the time, Antoinette Arnoux, plays an important role. Not only is she the subject of the painting on the wall, but the composition’s high viewpoint and plunging, wide-angled perspective draw all attention to her as she sits on the balcony, her back to the sea. Framed by shimmering curtains, she gazes directly at the viewer.</p>

Mark Rothko,Number 19,United States,1949,1949,Oil on canvas,172.8 × 101.8 cm (68 × 40 1/8 in.),Anonymous gift,1957.308,['Contemporary Art'],,"<p>Like many of the New York School painters of the 1940s, Mark Rothko was largely influenced by Surrealism, creating symbolic abstractions comprised of biomorphic and mythological forms. By 1947 he abandoned such suggestive imagery and began working exclusively with how ideas of color, light, and space could be manifested in paint. <em>Number 19</em> follows the characteristic format of his transitional canvases, in which loosely defined shapes hover against a thinly brushed background. Color had become a defining force for Rothko, as had the atmospheric—even ghostly—layering of oil paint, which would lead to his signature color-field of the 1950s.</p>

Claude Monet,The Beach at Sainte-Adresse,France,1867,1867,Oil on canvas,75.8 × 102.5 cm (29 13/16 × 40 5/16 in.),Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection,1933.439,"['Painting and Sculpture of Europe', 'Essentials']",Impressionism,"<p>In the summer of 1867 Claude Monet stayed with his aunt in Sainte-Adresse, an affluent suburb of the port city of Le Havre in Normandy, where the artist grew up. Monet began the painting outdoors on an overcast day but likely revised the composition in his studio in view of other related canvases, especially the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s <em>Regatta at Sainte-Adresse</em> (51.30.4). <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9036/monet-and-chicago"">Technical analysis</a> revealed that what started as a scene of yachts and tourists at the beach ultimately became a view of sailboats and local fishermen. Monet first exhibited this painting at the Impressionist exhibition of 1876, the second of eight independent exhibitions he mounted with a group of like-minded avant-garde artists who sought to present their work outside of France’s traditional, state-sponsored Salon system.</p>

Marc Chagall,The Praying Jew,France,1923,1923,Oil on canvas,116.8 × 89.4 cm (46 × 35 3/16 in.),Joseph Winterbotham Collection,1937.188,['Modern Art'],Modernism,"<p>Marc Chagall had a prolific career that spanned more than eight decades of the twentieth century. While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism.</p>
<p>In his 1931 autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism.</p>
<p>Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s <em>Praying Jew</em> is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of <em>The Praying Jew</em> before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca’ Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.</p>

By the late 1960s, the artist began using pointed, single words— chosen as much for their evocative power as for their phonetic qualities—as visual subjects in a variety of media. Between 1966 and 1969, Ruscha made a series of “liquid” or “wet” word paintings, in which the linguistic effect is made more palpable by the trompe l’oeil renderings of the words, which suggest that they have been created from water, oil, syrup, or another fluid.</p>
